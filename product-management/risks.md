# Risks

When building a product, there are [four main risks](https://svpg.com/four-big-risks/):

* Value risk \(will people buy it, or choose to use it?\)
* Usability risk \(can users figure out how to use it?\)
* Feasibility risk \(can we build it with the time, skills, and technology we have?\)
* Business Viability risk \(will this solution work for the various dimensions of our business?\)
