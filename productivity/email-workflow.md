# Email Workflow

If it's available, I'd recommend reading the [original post](https://klinger.io/post/71640845938/dont-drown-in-email-how-to-use-gmail-more) instead

## How I use Gmail

* GTD - [Getting things done](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FGetting_Things_Done&t=NzcyYmM5MzRlYjhkNGRjNzFjMTYzMTBmNzcxYTJmYTJlZGVlYzA2OSxrTjlIazEwdQ%3D%3D&b=t%3A8RARsnult7flEuRLgYoA1g&p=https%3A%2F%2Fklinger.io%2Fpost%2F71640845938%2Fdont-drown-in-email-how-to-use-gmail-more&m=1)
* An easy to manage, usually **empty inbox** on the left
* All “todos” in the first box
* All emails “awaiting a reply” in the second
* All “delegated” emails in the third
* All emails related to meetings, flights, etc easy to find in the fourth
* **All done with 0 plugins, using only standard gmail features**

#### Daily Workflow

* An email comes in
* Handle those you can instantly
* The others mark as todo
* If you want to keep track of them when you replied, you mark them as “Awaiting Reply” or “Delegated” \(that way you can always quickly find them and follow up\)
* You archive all emails
* You inbox on the left is empty again
* All important ones are in the special boxes ones the right

#### Example Email

* Received an email
* Was able to reply instantly \(if i wouldn’t have had the time i would marked it as yellow bang \(Todo\)\)
* I replied
* Marked with “awaiting reply” \(question mark\)
* Archived the email
* The email is no longer in my inbox but in my “awaiting reply list” on the right side
* His reply will come into my inbox \(and we start over with replying instantly or marking as action\)
* Archive - Inbox Zero

**That’s it! You are done.**

## **Setup**

In a nutshell it’s

* Multiple inboxes
* Special stars
* The multiple inboxes have searches matching the special stars
* Several filters to avoid repetitive tasks

**Add multiple inboxes**

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%284%29.png)

* Go to Settings \(you will find it under the cogs icon on the top right\)
* Go to Labs
* Enable Multiple Inboxes
* Choose right side layout

**Choose the correct special stars**

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%281%29.png)

* Go to Settings &gt; General
* Scroll down to Stars
* Add the stars you will want to use

I use:

* Yellow bang for Todo
* Red bang for Important Todo
* Question mark for emails I expect or await a reply. \(so i can followup\)
* Orange guillemet \(double arrow\) for emails i delegated to someone but expect to be done. \(so i can follow up\)
* Purple star for any arranged meeting, flights, event tickets, call or anything else related to an event where i might need to find that stuff quickly.

**Filter the inboxes to match the stars**

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%282%29.png)

* Go to Settings &gt; Multiple Inboxes
* Switch to right side layout - the option is in the bottom **\(!\)**
* Add the filter rules you want for your inboxes

Here is the list of all names of the stars:

* has:red-star
* has:orange-star
* has:green-star
* has:blue-star
* has:purple-star
* has:red-bang
* has:orange-guillemet
* has:yellow-bang
* has:green-check
* has:blue-info
* has:purple-question

You can btw also do more complex filters by adding OR, AND or basically anything else you can use in search. Eg. I use OR to show both important and VERY important todos.

**Note on mobile:** If you use the mobile Gmail App a lot i would suggest to use the normal yellow star for todo. That way you can at least mark todos in mobile. Unfortunately the other features won’t work as well because the gmail app doesn’t support them.

**Enable the inbox layout \(aka kill the tabs ;\) \)**

This part is a bit annoying - basically you need to disable a lot of fancy default features of gmail. If the new multiple inbox layout doesn’t appear in your inbox after you finished the guide you might have missed some step here.

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%283%29.png)

* **Go to Settings &gt; Inbox**
* Switch to “default”
* Turn off any configuration you might have regarding tabs
* Turn off any configuration regarding priority, important emails or filters
* **Go to your inbox**
* Click on the cog and click on “Configure Inbox”
* Remove everything
* And while you are at it: Switch layout to “compact”

**Now reload**
