# Email Workflow

In a nutshell it’s

* Multiple inboxes
* Special stars
* The multiple inboxes have searches matching the special stars
* Several filters to avoid repetitive tasks

**Add multiple inboxes**

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%284%29.png)

* Go to Settings \(you will find it under the cogs icon on the top right\)
* Go to Labs
* Enable Multiple Inboxes
* Choose right side layout

**Choose the correct special stars**

* Go to Settings &gt; General
* Scroll down to Stars
* Add the stars you will want to use

I use:

* Yellow bang for Todo
* Red bang for Important Todo
* Question mark for emails I expect or await a reply. \(so i can followup\)
* Orange guillemet \(double arrow\) for emails i delegated to someone but expect to be done. \(so i can follow up\)
* Purple star for any arranged meeting, flights, event tickets, call or anything else related to an event where i might need to find that stuff quickly.

**Filter the inboxes to match the stars**

* Go to Settings &gt; Multiple Inboxes
* Switch to right side layout - the option is in the bottom **\(!\)**
* Add the filter rules you want for your inboxes

Here is the list of all names of the stars:

* has:red-star
* has:orange-star
* has:green-star
* has:blue-star
* has:purple-star
* has:red-bang
* has:orange-guillemet
* has:yellow-bang
* has:green-check
* has:blue-info
* has:purple-question

You can btw also do more complex filters by adding OR, AND or basically anything else you can use in search. Eg. I use OR to show both important and VERY important todos.

**Note on mobile:** If you use the mobile Gmail App a lot i would suggest to use the normal yellow star for todo. That way you can at least mark todos in mobile. Unfortunately the other features won’t work as well because the gmail app doesn’t support them.

**Enable the inbox layout \(aka kill the tabs ;\) \)**

This part is a bit annoying - basically you need to disable a lot of fancy default features of gmail. If the new multiple inbox layout doesn’t appear in your inbox after you finished the guide you might have missed some step here.

* **Go to Settings &gt; Inbox**
* Switch to “default”
* Turn off any configuration you might have regarding tabs
* Turn off any configuration regarding priority, important emails or filters
* **Go to your inbox**
* Click on the cog and click on “Configure Inbox”
* Remove everything
* And while you are at it: Switch layout to “compact”

**Now reload**
